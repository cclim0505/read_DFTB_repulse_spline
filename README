Code to read DFTB sk file spline parameters to plot repulsive energy.

Units are in atomic units.
length: atomic units
energy: hartree

Output will give both hartree and eV units

# How to use

1. Prepare spline parameter file. 
Copy the first line that contains the word "Spline" up until the last parameter.


2. Use bash script "calc_repulsion.sh", and run
`calc_repulsion.sh spline_file.txt`

3. Check results in two output files, containing eV and hartree energy units.
